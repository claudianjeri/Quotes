# Quotes Application
##by Claudia.

##Description and application behavior
This is my Moringa School project. 
Its an application that allows a user to:
> To create a quote and view it.
> To view already listed quotes.
> To delete a quote.
> To give a thumbs up or down to an individual quote.
> To view extra info for a particular quote, i.e: 
  the author and the date

##Technology Used:
This application was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.8.
It uses bootstrap, css and javascript.  



## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
